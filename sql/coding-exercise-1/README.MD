# SQL code exercise #1

If you're asked to create a database for an online teaching platform, how would you design your database and tables according to the following data set?

- The platform region is Arab World.
- Over 20000 student are enrolled to the platform plans.
- The platform has over 50 instructors and 10 coordinators.
- Around 1000 courses can be found on the platform's site.
- The platform provides their students with 4 different diplomas (Laravel backend, Node.js backend... etc.).
- Courses can be categorized (Web, Mobile, JavaScript... etc.)

Translate the previous data set into valid SQL queries to create the platform database.

Note: Try as much as possible to design a scalable database by dividing the data set into various tables where you see fit.
